# Layouts

## Overview

Layout components offer solutions to organize and structure your UI with components like **Modals**, **Drawers**, **Accordions** etc.

Since layout components are purely for presentational organization, they are not connected to the Threekit API and can be even be used outside of the Threekit Provider or Page Layout context.
