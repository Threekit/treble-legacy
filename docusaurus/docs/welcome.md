# Treble Framework

:::info Beta version
Treble is currently available as a preview for developers. The library and documentation will be evolving quickly as we refine this project for launch.
:::

## Welcome to Treble!

Treble is a React powered framework used to build frontend web-experiences for Threekit Configurators.

## Less talk, more code.

To jump right in you can add Treble to an existing React project by adding the package with the command:

```bash
yarn add @threekit-tools/treble
```

Or you can bootstrap a new Treble project by using the following command, replacing `app-name` for the name of your project:

```bash
npx create-treble-app app-name
```

For a more details on how to use Treble head over to out Getting Started section in the side menu.
