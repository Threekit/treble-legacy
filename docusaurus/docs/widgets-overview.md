# Widgets

## Overview

The **Widgets** offer a wide range of functionality and interactivity for the user to engage with including Downloadable Snapshots, Zoom Buttons, Save-to-Wishlist etc.

All the widgets are designed to be buttons that can be placed on and around the Threekit Player. Placing the Widgets on the Player component enhances their visibility for the end user, builds consistent experiences with our player and minimizes/simplifies the Threekit UI footprint when embedding into an existing page.
