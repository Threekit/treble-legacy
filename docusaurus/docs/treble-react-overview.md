# Overview

## Brief

The Treble React package follows a 'Provider' Pattern where all the React code that interacts with the Threekit API is placed inside the ThreekitProvider. Within the ThreekitProvider context all Threekit components and hooks have complete flexibility in where and how they're used while still fully connected to the Threekit API, the 3D Player, and each other.

Treble provides 3 main family of features: Expanded functionality, including react-hooks, that provide direct ways to implement higher-level features, components built using that functionality to provide UI presentational elements for the configurator and many other features, and tools which allow us to add new and custom interactivity to the 3D.
