# Best Practices

### Keep it lightweight

Keep the portion of the UI that Threekit interacts with to a minimum. Ideally on the UI that directly interacts with the Threekit API should built out for a project.

### Widgets on the Player

Place widgets on the player.

### Curate the experience by organizing form

Don't overload the user with too much information and too many choices at once. Break up the form in space and in time, presenting them with a clear set of instructions and actions at any given time in the configuration process.

### Minimize required clicks

Configuring should be playful and fun. Organizing the form for clarity should be balanced by the ability for the user to quickly move through many configurations without too much hassle.

### Consider interactions on mobile
