## Overview

Hooks are the functional building blocks of our components and any project. They provide a way for components to connect statefuly to the Threekit API. We build all our native and custom components using hooks, so if you ever need a new UI component for an existing UX feature, you can use our hooks and focus on just the UI component and its styling.
