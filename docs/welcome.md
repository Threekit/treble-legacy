# Treble Framework

:::info beta version
The Treble Framework is currently available as a **preview for developers**. The library and documentation will be evolving quickly as we refine this project for launch.
:::

## Welcome to Treble!

Treble is a React-based framework to build embeddable web-experiences for Threekit Configurators. It offers a growing library of components and hooks that address common feature requirements for eCommerce experiences.

## How to use this guide

To **get more familiar with the Treble framework** you can head over to the [Main Concepts](main-concepts-introduction) section.

If you want to dive right in and **build your own Treble App** you can follow the [step-by-step tutorial](tutorial-setup).

Or if you're looking for **detailed documentation** on a specific [component](components-overview), [hook](hooks-overview) or [API](treble-js-treble-api) you can jump right into the relevant section through the sidebar navigation.

## Less talk, more code!

To jump right in, bootstrap a new Treble App by using the following command:

```bash
npx create-treble-app@latest
```
