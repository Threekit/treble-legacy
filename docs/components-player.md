# Player

```jsx
<Player />
```

## Overview

The `<Player />` component renders the **Threekit 2D/3D Player**.

The Player also includes layout containers for placing `Widgets` onto the player itself. The container must be used as a child of the Player component; with its own children/content being placed in the location the widget container specified.

The available Widget containers are:

- TopRightWidgets
- TopCenterWidgets
- TopLeftWidgets
- MiddleRightWidgets
- MiddleLeftWidgets
- BottomRightWidgets
- BottomCenterWidgets
- BottomLeftWidgets

The containers are available on the Player itself and can be used directly from the component if needed,

e.g. `<Player.TopRightWidgets> </Player.TopRightWidgets>`

> ðŸ“˜ Player needs a height
>
> The Player requires that it always have a defined height 1px or greater. We recommend you pass in a height value into the component props.

## Code Examples

#### Basic Setup

The basic implementation of the Player component

```jsx
import { ThreekitProvider, Player } from '@threekit-tools/treble';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThreekitProvider>
      <Player />
    </ThreekitProvider>
  );
};
```

#### Adding Widgets to the Player

Example of how to use the widget containers.

```jsx
import { ThreekitProvider, Player, Share, Zoom } from '@threekit-tools/treble';

//  We can separate out the widget container component
//  or use the component directly from the Player component
const { TopRightWidgets } = Player;

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThreekitProvider>
      <Player>
        <TopRightWidgets>
          <Share />
        </TopRightWidgets>

        <Player.BottomCenterWidgets>
          <Zoom />
        </Player.BottomCenterWidgets>
      </Player>
    </ThreekitProvider>
  );
};
```
