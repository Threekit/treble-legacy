## Await Player Load

The `<AwaitPlayerLoad>` wrapper, is used to wrap any content that we don't want to render until the Threekit Player initialization process is complete.

```jsx
import { AwaitPlayerLoad } from 'threekit/components';

const Component = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <div>Content here will be rendered as normal</div>
      <AwaitPlayerLoad>
        This content will only be rendered after the Threekit Player
        intialization is complete
      </AwaitPlayerLoad>
    </div>
  );
};
```
