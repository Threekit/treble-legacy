# Accordian

### A Simple Accordian component

## Overview

The `<Accordian />` component can be used anywhere in the app.
It does not connect to any attribute type or even to the
ThreekitProvider and as such it can be used as a general
UI element.

The Accordian is useful for general UI experiences but can also be used to embed the player
itself as well as a full configurator if required
## How to Use

Example of how to use a **Accordian** component:

```
<Accordion>
   <AccordionItem key={0} label={"AccordionItem 1"}>
       AccordionItem content
   </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```
