## Overview

`<Drawer />` can be used anywhere in the app.
It does not connect to the
ThreekitProvider and as such it can be used as a general
UI element.

## When to Use

A `<Drawer />` is useful for Configurator UI when screen real estate is at a premium. In situations where
as much of the screen as possible needs to be taken up by the player as possible the configurator UI can be put in a `<Drawer />`
so as to conserve screen real estate. One situation where a drawer is ideal is on mobile devices.

The drawer is also ffully capable of showing the player if that is required.


## How to Use
Any children of the drawer will be rendered inside of the slide-in drawer.

## Props

<ArgsTable of={Drawer} />
