# Getting Started with Treble

This project boilerplate was bootstrapped with [Create Treble App](https://github.com/threekit/treble).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Starts the local development server, available
in your browser on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and
builds out into a single file for easy embedding.

The build is minified and has the file name `threekit-embed.js`.

The build step is optimized for use with Treble Launchpad.
